        <h3>Seriously, another ODM?</h3>
	<p>
	  Wait! Before you turn your nose up, ask yourself if you have ever
	  wanted to throw your current [Python] ODM [for MongoDB] out the
	  window.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Yes? You have? Well, you're in luck. Hopefully this ODM sucks
	  significantly less than the one that gave you those grey hairs.
	  (Don't worry, they aren't that noticeable.)
	</p>
	<p>
	  What makes PureODM so much better? Well, for starters I don't do 
	  anything for you. You're all big girls, and boys, and I figure you
	  know exactly how you want to connect to your database, and I'm pretty
	  sure you would rather have anything I do, done in plain sight.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Let me put it this way: PureODM is an object-to-document mapper. It
	  will not manage your connections for you, it will not create and
	  maintain indexes for you, in fact, it will not do anything but turn
	  results from a pymongo query into an object, for you.
	</p>

	<h3>So, how do I work this thing?</h3>
	<p>
	  Hopefully, it's pretty straight forward.
	</p>
	<p>
	  After you get it installed (which should be relatively painless),
	  all you need to do is...

	  <pre>
	    <code>
	      import pureodm

	      class Bread(pureodm.Model):

	          fields = {'grain': {'default': 'wheat',
                                      'type': str,
                                      'required': True},
	                    'fiber_content': {'default': 1,
                                              'type': int}}
	    </code>
	  </pre>

	  ...and that's pretty much it.
