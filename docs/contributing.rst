Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute to PureODM, feel free to fork it, do your thing,
and then submit a pull request.

One thing to keep in mind, is that PureODM uses
`git-flow <https://github.com/nvie/gitflow>`_ for branch and release management.
Once you have your local working copy of your fork cloned (and you have git-flow
installed), just run::

  $ git flow init -d
